A common use of the AWS Lambda service is to set a function to run on a 
recurring schedule, e.g. to collect logs, move data, or perform some ETL process.
In this post, we'll see how we can set up an AWS Lambda function, running `R`, on 
a schedule.

## A lambda runtime function

We start with a simple function that does not require any input and does not return
anything. If this example lambda is to run on a schedule, we don't want to worry
about any input arguments. Also, we want this lambda function to simply have a 
side effect, like printing something to the logs, without returning any data or writing
to a database. This will help us greatly with the setup, in that we'll be able to deploy 
and schedule the lambda with minimal involvement from other AWS services.

With this in mind, we have the following function that simply prints the system time.
Printing the current time makes sense because we can easily check that the lambda runs
on the correct schedule from the logs.

```{r}
current_time <- function() {
  print(paste("CURRENT TIME: ", Sys.time()))
}
```

## Build, test, and deploy

Then, we follow the procedure described in [Tidy Tuesday dataset Lambda post](/post/an-r-aws-lambda-function-to-download-tidytuesday-datasets/).
We write this to a file that we'll use to build the lambda `docker` image:

```{r}
r_code <- "
  current_time <- function() {
    print(paste('CURRENT TIME:', Sys.time()))
  }
  
  lambdr::start_lambda()
"

tmpfile <- tempfile(pattern = "current_time_lambda_", fileext = ".R")
write(x = r_code, file = tmpfile)
```

And then build the `docker` image. Note that we don't have any dependencies other 
than base `R`.

```{r}
r2lambda::build_lambda(
  tag = "current_time",
  runtime_function = "current_time",
  runtime_path = tmpfile,
  dependencies = NULL
)
```

We test the lambda docker container locally, because it makes sense. The console 
output should include the log messages and the standard output string showing the
current time.

```{r}
r2lambda::test_lambda(tag = "current_time", payload = list())
```

Then, we deploy the lambda to AWS, leaving the lambda environment to its defaults, 
as 3 seconds should be enough to get and print the current time.

```{r}
r2lambda::deploy_lambda(tag = "current_time")
```

Finally, to make sure everything went well, we invoke the cloud instance of our 
function. Be sure to include the logs, as this particular function does not return 
anything. 

```{r}
r2lambda::invoke_lambda(
  function_name = "current_time",
  invocation_type = "RequestResponse",
  payload = list(),
  include_logs = TRUE
)
```

## Schedule to run every minute

To make a lambda function run on a recurring schedule, we need to update an already 
deployed function. This involves three steps and two AWS services, [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) 
for serverless computing and [EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) 
for serverless event routing:

- creating a schedule event role (EventBridge, `paws::eventbridge`)
- adding permissions to this role to invoke lambda functions (Lambda, `paws::lambda`)
- adding our target lambda function to event (EventBridge, `paws::eventbridge`)

Detailed instructions are available in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-run-lambda-schedule.html).
The function `schedule_lambda` abstracts these three steps in one go. To set a Lambda 
on a schedule, we need the name of the function we wish to update, and the rate at which
we want EventBridge to invoke it. Two expression formats for setting the rate are supported, 
`cron` and `rate`. For example, to schedule a lambda to run every Sunday at midnight, 
we could use `execution_rate = "cron(0 0 * * Sun)"`. Alternatively, to schedule a lambda
to run every 15 minutes, we might use `execution_rate = "rate(15 minutes)"`. The details are
in this [AWS article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html)

```{r}
r2lambda::schedule_lambda(
  lambda_function = "current_time", 
  execution_rate = "rate(1 minute)"
  )
```

## Checking the AWS logs

To see if our function runs every minute, we can take a look at the AWS logs. If the 
function was writing to a database, or dropping files in an S3 bucket, we could also check 
the contents of those resources for the effects of the scheduled lambda function. But as
our example function only prints the current time, the only way to know that it indeed runs
every minute is to check the logs.

To do this, we'll use `paws` and `r2lambda::aws_connect` to establish an AWS CloudWatchLogs
service locally, and fetch the recent logs to look for traces of our lambda function.

In the first step, we connect to `cloudwatchlogs` and fetch the names of the log groups.
Inspect the `logs` object below to find the name corresponding to the lambda function
whose logs we want to fetch.

```{r}
logs_service <- r2lambda::aws_connect(service = "cloudwatchlogs")
logs <- logs_service$describe_log_groups()
(logGroups <- sapply(logs$logGroups, "[[", 1))
```

Then, we can grab only the data for our scheduled lambda function:

```{r}
current_time_lambda_logs <- logs_service$filter_log_events(
  logGroupName = "/aws/lambda/current_time")
```

And pull only the message printed by our `R` function wrapped in the lambda:

```{r}
messages <- sapply(current_time_lambda_logs$events, "[[", "message")
current_time_messages <- messages[grepl("CURRENT TIME", messages)]
data.frame(Current_time_lambda = current_time_messages)

#>                         Current_time_lambda
#> 1 [1] "CURRENT TIME: 2023-02-26 22:53:55"\n
#> 2 [1] "CURRENT TIME: 2023-02-26 22:54:41"\n
#> 3 [1] "CURRENT TIME: 2023-02-26 22:55:41"\n
#> 4 [1] "CURRENT TIME: 2023-02-26 22:56:41"\n
#> 5 [1] "CURRENT TIME: 2023-02-26 22:57:41"\n

```

Evidently, the Lambda function printed the system time every one minute, as we 
intended!

## Clean up

We don't want to let a this lambda fire every minute, even if trivial it still 
uses resources and incurs some cost. So its wise to delete the event schedule 
rule and maybe even the lambda function it self.

To remove the event rule, we first need to remove associated targets. In the code
below, we connect to EventBridge, lookup the names of all event rules, find the
rule we wish to remove (in this case the most-recent one with index 1), and then,
first remove its target followed by deleting the rule it self. (I'll probably
add a function abstract this procedure in the `{r2lamdba}` package.)

```{r}
# connect to the EventBridge service
events_service <- r2lambda::aws_connect("eventbridge")
# find the names of all rules 
schedule_rules <- events_service$list_rules()[[1]] %>% sapply("[[", 1)

# find the targets associated with the rule we want to remove
rule_to_remove <- schedule_rules[[1]]

target_arn_to_remove <- events_service$list_targets_by_rule(Rule = rule_to_remove)$Targets[[1]]$Id
events_service$remove_targets(Rule = rule_to_remove, Ids = target_arn_to_remove)
events_service$delete_rule(Name = rule_to_remove)

events_service$list_rules()[[1]] %>% sapply("[[", 1)

```

Finally, to remove the Lambda, we do something similar. Look up the names of all
deployed functions on our account, and then delete the one(s) we'd like to delete.

```{r}
lambda_service <- r2lambda::aws_connect("lambda")
lambda_service$list_functions()$Functions %>% sapply("[[","FunctionName")
lambda_service$delete_function(FunctionName = "current_time")
```

## Summary

In this post: 
  - we wrote a simple lambda runtime function, 
  - built a docker image locally,
  - tested the lambda invocation, 
  - deployed it to AWS Lambda, 
  - updated it to run on a schedule,
  - checked the AWS logs to confirm it executes at the correct times, and 
  - cleaned up our AWS environment. 

I hope you found this tutorial useful, and that it will motivate you to try the `{r2lambda}` 
package. It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/discindo/r2lambda) and can 
be installed with `remotes::install_github`. I am looking for feedback on whether or 
not the workflows from `r2lambda` are working for other people -- not many have 
tried it so far. I am also interested in suggestions on how to 
improve the interface, what features to add, what additional documentation to include, 
and so on. Try it and share your experience!
