Welcome to `discindo.org`! This is a space where we document our learning and discoveries
as we navigate through the data science + data engineering universe. We mostly focus on `R` and 
`Shiny` and how to build data solutions using these in the cloud.  

Our [projects](/project) page has packages and tools we have developed as `free software`. 

Our [website](https://discindodata.com) has description of previous projects and references from our clients.

We would love to hear from you! Please get in touch through the [contact](/contact) page.
